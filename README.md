    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    
    The client wanted to expand their existing game Draw it or Lose it from a web based application to other platforms such as android or iOS. The client was the company that created the game draw it or lose it. The client wanted me to code the game to make it compatible with multiple platforms and added security features as well.
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    I was able to compare and contrast the benefits of traditional systems and cloud based systems. It was important to understand things like costs, and scalability.
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    It was able to keep me on track and focus on one thing at a time to ensure each step was handled properly.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I would add different security features and recommendations, I would also look for other solutions for memory handling and storage management.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    I was able to interpret the user's needs by looking at what they had coming into the project, and what could be expanded upon based on their request. I was also able to look at what challenges or limitations may be presented. It is important to consider the user's needs because if these needs are not met the user's will look elsewhere to get the project done and their needs met.
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    I took a compartmentalized approach. I first identify what is needed, why it is needed, and what options are available regarding implementation. In the future I would try implementing things differently, may be try it two different ways to see what would make sense given the situation at hand.
